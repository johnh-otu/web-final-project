# web-final-project
This is the repository for our final project in SOFE2800 (Web Programming).

The project is a demo for an online shopping site featuring a store page, a product page, and a purchase page that displays cart items.
This was our first introduction to web development. 
It taught us how to use Bootstrap, cookies, GET/POST requests, PHP, mySQL, and many other web dev tools.
